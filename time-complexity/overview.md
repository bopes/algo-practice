# Time Complexity
Practice reducing time complexity for algorithms that could be easily solved using repeated or nested iteration.

### Challenges
* Frog Jumps: [Ruby](frog-jump.rb) | [Python](frog_jump.py)
* Missing Element: [Ruby](missing-element.rb) | [Python](tape_equilibrium.py)
* Tape Equilibrium: [Ruby](tape-equilibrium.rb)
